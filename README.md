# Goal
To explain the SOLID Principles, from Object-oriented design, using code samples.

## What is SOLID?
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP), see [Java project explaining the SRP and DIP](/java "Java project")
- **O**pen/**c**losed Principle (OCP), see [C# project explaining the OCP](/csharp "C# project")
- **L**iskov substitution principle (LSP), see [JavaScript project explaining the LSP](/js "JavaScript project")
- **I**nterface segregation principle (ISP), see [Scala project explaining the ISP](/scala "Scala project")
- **D**ependency inversion principle (DIP), see [Java project explaining the SRP and DIP](/java "Java project")


## Why this repository?
These code sample are support files for [Tales Of Agile Adoption](http://tales-of-agile-adoption.blogspot.com "Blog home"), SOLID explanations:
